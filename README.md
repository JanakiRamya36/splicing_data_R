# Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling with Synthetic Splicing Dataset  

## Project Overview 
This project explores splicing factor relationships using a synthetic splicing dataset, to understand the impact of splicing factors on splicing events. 

## Data Analysis  
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, detecting outliers, and structuring variables for analysis.  
- Conducted descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to assess relationships between splicing factors and the splicing event.  
- Visualized data using histograms, Q-Q plots, box plots, and scatter plots to identify trends and distributions.  
- Built a multivariate linear regression model (R2 = 0.61, p < 0.001), evaluating the impact of splicing factors on the splicing event.  
- Validated model performance using cross-validation, achieving an R2 of 0.64 on the test set.  
- Assessed model assumptions, ensuring linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity for a robust predictive model.
